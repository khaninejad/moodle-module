"# moodle-module" version is too old so someone had to make things right. 


rename widget to your module name includes folder names, highly recommend Atom(use ctrl+shift+f or ctrl + P)

Copy the folder in mod dir

Navigate to site administration -> module activity 

Wait for installation 


You can view the module by mod/widget URL but don't forget to input an id parameter


Have a nice day
